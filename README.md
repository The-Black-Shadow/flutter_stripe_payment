## Features

- üîê Secure Stripe payment integration
- üì± Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
- üåü Modern Flutter UI with Material Design
- üîë Environment-based configuration
- üí≥ Card payment processing
- ‚úÖ Payment success/failure handling

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher) - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK
- A Stripe account - [Sign up for Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
- An IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd flutter_stripe_payment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Stripe keys:

```bash
# Create .env file in the root directory
touch .env
```

Add the following content to your `.env` file:

```env
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notes:**

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use test keys during development
- Keep your secret key secure and never expose it in client-side code
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file

### 4. Get Your Stripe Keys

1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to **Developers > API keys**
3. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
4. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
5. Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file

4. **View results** - success or error messages will be displayed

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Run Integration Tests

```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Test with Stripe Test Cards

Use these test card numbers in development:

- **Successful payment**: `4242424242424242`
- **Declined payment**: `4000000000000002`
- **Insufficient funds**: `4000000000009995`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment variables not loading**

   - Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Check that your keys are properly formatted
   - Restart the app after adding environment variables

2. **Build errors**

   - Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
   - Check that all dependencies are compatible

3. **Platform-specific issues**
   - Ensure minimum SDK requirements are met
   - Check platform-specific configurations
